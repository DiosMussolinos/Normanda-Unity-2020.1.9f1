  - The majority of people die at 30. If I can't sell my drinks to minors I will
    go bankrupt!
  - I'm thinking of buying the upstairs floor and expanding my business with women,
    if you know what I mean.
  - Believe me or not, my most loyal consumer is the priest.
  - The best part of my job is confessing weird things to drunk customers and then
    saying I never said anything. You should see their faces.
  - If you need a therapist it's on the other side of the street.
  - Drink options? I have green ale, orange ale, and red ale. It's a medieval game,
    what did you expect?
  - I listen about a princess that went to the other world and neve came back. There
    are rummors that she is a god now.
  - Last time someone like you arrive, the princess wasn't kidnapped and we had a
    king.
  - My child, you wouldn't believe in all the stories that i have listen in my life.
  - With all the problems that we have, there is a punk around that poison peoples
    drinks. Don't accept anything from strangers...
  - 'A wise men once told me: "be drunk during a fight, so you don''t notice if you
    lose".'
  - Everything can be solved with a drink, a sword and a woman!
